# 🏟️ Match Details

Every match becomes its own story — with score, timeline, statistics and AI analysis.

## Score & teams

</div>

- **Large score display** with color coding (Red = home, Blue = away)
- **Club names** with country flags (🇩🇪 Borussia Dortmund vs. 🇪🇸 Atletico Madrid)
- **Mode badge** (2v2)
- **Date** in long German format ("Thursday, 26 February 2026")
- **Team lineups** with player avatars or initials

## Match timeline (score timeline)

<div align="center">
<img src="../screenshots/spiele-details-3.png" width="320" />
</div>

The vertical timeline shows each goal chronologically — from bottom (kick-off) to top (final whistle):

- **Red dots & badges** — home goals (left)
- **Blue dots & badges** — away goals (right)
- **Center line** — time axis
- **Divider lines** with labels for extra time (n.V.) and penalties (n.E.)
- **Penalty icon** 🥅 for spot kicks

> Example: A 6:5 after penalties — with regular time, extra time and a dramatic penalty showdown.

## AI match report

<div align="center">
<img src="../screenshots/match-report.png" width="320" />
</div>

Generated **automatically** once match stats are available. The report is:

- **Written in German**
- **Entertaining** in tone — like a sports commentator
- **Data-driven** — includes possession, xG, career data
- **Narrative** — detects stories like underdog wins, comebacks, streak breaks

> *"What a crazy comeback by Borussia Dortmund! Atletico Madrid dominated for 80 minutes with 80% possession, but then the Dortmund duo struck back..."*
