# 🎮 New Match

The match wizard guides you in three steps from player selection to the final result.

---

## Step 1 — select players

</div>

- All registered players are shown
- **Tap** a player to assign them to a team
- The home team (red) appears on the left, the away team (blue) on the right
- The **match mode** (1v1 / 2v2) is detected automatically
- **Guests** can be added for spontaneous participants
- Selected players are highlighted

---

## Step 2 — choose teams

<div align="center">

</div>

- Choose from **500+ real clubs** worldwide
- **Autocomplete search**: type the club name
- Clubs from top leagues: Bundesliga, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and more
- Each club shows a **country flag** and **league assignment**
- Selected teams are included in the **league stats** on the profile

## Step 3 — score & AI prediction

</div>

When you reach step 3, two things happen at once:

### AI match prediction

The AI **automatically** analyzes historical data and provides a prediction. It considers:

- Current form and win rates of all players
- Head-to-head records between opponents
- xG efficiency and career stats
- Favorite teams and their motivational influence
- Estimated final score

### Entering the score

- Enter goals **one by one** — each goal is recorded separately
- Full **match timeline** (score timeline)
- **Extra time** (n.V.) and **penalties** (n.E.) supported
- Optional: attach an **FC26 stats screenshot** directly

### FC26 stats (optional)

At the end of the wizard you can upload a screenshot of the FC26 post-match stats. The AI automatically extracts all values — and an **automatic match report** is generated on the match detail page.

---

## After saving

- The match appears immediately on the **dashboard**, in **match history** and on the **leaderboard**
- All stats, streaks and badges are updated automatically
- If stats were uploaded: the app redirects to the match detail page with stats and the AI report
