</div>

Aggregated values from all matches with FC26 statistics. A 2x2 grid shows the four key career metrics:

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Avg possession** | 54% | Average possession across all matches |
| **Avg pass accuracy** | 88% | How accurate are your passes? |
| **xG efficiency** | 1.08x | Goals vs. Expected Goals — >1.0 means you score more than expected |
| **Avg duels won** | 59% | How many duels do you win? |

> Career stats appear only once at least one match with FC26 stats exists. Top-right shows how many matches the values are calculated from.
